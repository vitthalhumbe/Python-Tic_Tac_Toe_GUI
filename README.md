# Tic Tac Toe Game

Author: Vitthal Humbe

## Description

This is a simple implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game using Python and Tkinter.

## How to Play

- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- Two players take turns to place their marks ('X' or 'O') on the grid.
- The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
- If the entire grid is filled and no player has won, the game is a draw.
